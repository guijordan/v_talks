################# IDIOMS ###############
WHAT ARE IDIOMS ?
A GROUP OF WORDS, THAT HAS A SPECIAL MEANING THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORDINARY MEANING OF EACH SEPARATE WORD. FOR EXAMPLE, TO KICK THE BUCKET
THAT MEANS TO DIE.

THE MEANING OF IDIOMS CAN BE USUSALLY PERCEIVED THROUGH THE CONTEXT. 
LET'S THINK ABOUT MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AND TRAVELING FOR EXAMPLE.

TO PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. - TO DO THINGS IN THE WRONG ORDER; 
TO JUMP INTO CONCLUSIONS.

TO BE IN THE SAME BOAT - TO BE IN THE SAME DIFFICULT OR UNPLEASANT SITUATION AS SOMEONE ELSE.


TO MISS THE BOAT - TO FAIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN OPPORTUNITY BY NOT TAKING ACTION QUICKLY ENOUGH. 

TO HIT THE ROAD - TO LEAVE OR START A JOURNEY.
TO BE A BACKSEAT DRIVER - TO KEEP GIVING ADVICE ON THINGS YOU ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR.

TO HAVE ITCHY FEET - TO WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE NEW (OR TO TRAVEL) OR TO DO 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT CONSTANTY. 

ONE IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADIVE:
YOU LEARN IDIOMS AS YOU PRACTICE THE LANGUAGE AND ANALYZE THE CONTEXT.
IN OTHE WORDS, DON'T TRY TO MEMORIZE THEM ALL, BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND 
INEFFICIENT.
